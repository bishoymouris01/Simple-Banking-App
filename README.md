I created a simple Java project for a Banking back-end application to practice essential Java concepts. The application greets users with a personalized welcome message, allowing them to check their balance, deposit, withdraw, view previous transactions, and exit. It utilizes Java classes, constructors, methods, switch statements, a Scanner for user input, if conditions for validation, encapsulation for data protection, a Do-While loop for menu navigation, and Lambda Expressions for streamlined code.
